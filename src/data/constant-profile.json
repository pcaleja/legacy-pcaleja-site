  "about": "Hi! I'm a self-taught Web Designer/Developer with a degree in Industrial Design.  Through academia, I learned the value of design when creating a product. I also learned that I enjoy bringing designs to life in the digital world with code. As a result, I decided to pursue this field which encompasses both design and development.<br><br>The past couple of years, I've been focusing solely in learning front-end technologies, but recently, I've been slowly delving into back-end technologies to reach my current goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer. I'm currently looking for an opportunity to work on a web application that would make use of my skills in front-end development, while exposing me to back-end development challenges as well."
