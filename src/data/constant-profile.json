  "about": "Hi! I'm a self-taught Web Designer/Developer with a degree in Industrial Design. Through academia, I learned the value of design when creating a product. I also learned that I enjoy bringing designs to life in the digital world with code. As a result, I decided to pursue this field which encompasses both design and development.<br><br>The past couple of years, I've been focusing solely in learning front-end technologies, but recently, I've been slowly delving into back-end technologies to reach my current goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer.<br><br>I'm currently happily employed in NYONair as a full-time web developer though I'm also looking for side project opportunities that I can work on off hours."
